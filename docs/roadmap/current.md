## v0.4.0 — Practical UI Authoring

Objective: **Tessera で普通に UI を書ける。** Prove that a developer can build a small application through a high-level C++ API and reusable widgets, without assembling reactive graph nodes, component mounting records, owner registrations, reconciliation tables or renderer internals for ordinary UI composition.

The runtime is the deterministic foundation. This milestone prioritizes authoring experience, composition, practical widgets and feedback from a real application. The [authoring proposal](../proposals/cpp-authoring.md) owns possible API mechanisms; the [Settings application design](../integrations/settings-app.md) owns the consumer workflow. Exact public syntax is open, and every convenience must lower into the ordinary runtime.

### Current slice

Review authoring friction between the [first app](../guides/first-app.md) and the [Settings workflow](../integrations/settings-app.md), using the [implemented form API](../architecture/ui-model.md#implemented-c-form-authoring). Choose the next bounded application operation from actual composition, style or host-integration work; keep ordinary authoring separate from host command, input and presentation responsibilities.

```text
copy first app -> compose a Settings operation through public APIs
-> identify concrete authoring friction -> bound acceptance
-> reuse existing APIs or promote the minimum required convenience
```

Minimum scope:

- Review the copyable source and Settings composition against the release criteria, especially reusable application styles and the transition from a small form to editing, selection and scrolling.
- Reproduce a concrete developer operation through public APIs before calling an API/runtime gap a blocker. Distinguish ordinary composition friction from required host ownership and regression-only verification code.
- Record the observed operation and source evidence in [support](../reference/support-matrix.md). Before implementation, define its expected observable result, minimum scope and stop condition here; inactive proposal/widget inventory does not become active through this review.
- Reuse existing APIs where sufficient. Keep any further guide/example extension tied to the selected operation, following the [user documentation intent](../product/use-cases.md#learning-and-example-intent).

Slice acceptance: the review identifies a concrete next application operation and a bounded acceptance condition, or establishes that the reviewed criteria need no further API change. Source review is distinguished from executed behavior and validation evidence.

Stop this review after selecting that bounded operation or establishing sufficiency. Further widgets, style conveniences, clipboard, undo/redo, multiline, IME and platform hardening need separate consumer scope. Do not generalize widgets, lifecycle, layout or rendering to complete a proposal.

### Remaining milestone scope

Extend that same application in consumer order, with a bounded acceptance condition before each implementation slice:

Review authoring friction and grow widgets only from the application's needs. Add style conveniences or strengthen Row/Column, sizing, alignment, overflow and text-driven geometry only for demonstrated form requirements. Async observation, named slots, SplitPane, Stack/Overlay or bounded absolute positioning require their own consumer operation before becoming active work. Extend field editing only as application operations demand; full native text integration is not a release gate. Keep working source and [onboarding](../guides/getting-started.md) aligned as each operation is added; avoid publishing proposed syntax as a working guide.

### Release exit criteria

- A developer can create a small application through a high-level C++ API without low-level runtime assembly for ordinary UI composition; permanent syntax stability is not required.
- A basic component/widget library supports the reference application, including Text, Button, Row, Column, Checkbox and bounded TextInput. A complete widget inventory is not required.
- State and derived state have a simple public interface; reusable components support typed props/defaults, children, local state, command output, style attachment and stable identity where used. Conditional and repeated UI use the same runtime model.
- Common application styles are expressed without manually constructing low-level style machinery, and still resolve through the shared cascade/theme model.
- At least one application-shaped, copyable example exercises editing, scrolling, selection, styling, layout and host interaction through ordinary normalized input. Keyboard/gamepad navigation and command eligibility follow the common input boundary; platform claims require their own evidence.
- Deterministic replay, inspection and CPU-reference validation reproduce the application's accepted state, semantic observations, geometry and paint under declared inputs. Existing contract regressions remain covered.
- The runtime has one execution model for C++, documents, editor preview and automation. Run affected checks in Debug and Release and documentation checks; put configuration/results only in support and delivery history in the [changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md).

### Non-goals and stop condition

Do not make generalized lifecycle redesign, a new reactive graph, arbitrary reload migration, full reflection, generalized resource providers, complete Portal/OverlayRoot, full CSS/Grid, retained/incremental rendering, generalized multithreading, stable C ABI, Python/Rust/Go bindings, browser/WebGPU hosting, plugin frameworks, complete native accessibility, IDE tooling or a visual editor prerequisites for this release.

Stop milestone expansion when ordinary application authoring and the reference workflow meet these exit criteria. The [broader widget candidates](backlog.md#widget-candidates-beyond-the-reference-application), [editor extensions](backlog.md#unscheduled-editor-extensions), other language/platform work and performance candidates stay inactive until a concrete consumer promotes a bounded operation.
