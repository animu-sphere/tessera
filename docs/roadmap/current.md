## v0.4.0 — Practical UI Authoring

Objective: **Tessera で普通に UI を書ける。** Prove that a developer can build a small application through a high-level C++ API and reusable widgets, without assembling reactive graph nodes, component mounting records, owner registrations, reconciliation tables or renderer internals for ordinary UI composition.

The runtime is the deterministic foundation. This milestone prioritizes authoring experience, composition, practical widgets and feedback from a real application. The [authoring proposal](../proposals/cpp-authoring.md) owns possible API mechanisms; the [Settings application design](../integrations/settings-app.md) owns the consumer workflow. Exact public syntax is open, and every convenience must lower into the ordinary runtime.

### Current slice

Review the transition from the copyable [Settings edit/Apply starter](../guides/settings-starter.md) to the [section-selection](../integrations/settings-app.md#implemented-section-selection-boundary) and [constrained-scrolling](../integrations/settings-app.md#implemented-constrained-scrolling-boundary) consumer operations. Trace how a developer can add repeated choices, conditional content and a constrained form while preserving draft/edit/save ownership, focus and coherent full-tree publication through existing APIs.

Minimum scope:

- Compare the starter's composition and explicit host with the larger Settings fixture's section and scrolling paths. Separate reusable application composition from input, offset/reveal and publication responsibilities.
- Identify the next concrete onboarding operation and its observable acceptance, including retained draft/save observations and keyboard/gamepad reachability. Record source-review findings and limits only in [support](../reference/support-matrix.md).
- Promote only a demonstrated minimum consumer need into this section before implementation. A source trace alone does not establish a runtime defect or authorize a new widget, style facade, lifecycle or scrolling framework.

Stop after selecting one bounded follow-up with a reproducible operation and exit condition. Broader widget and platform candidates stay inactive. The [starter walkthrough](../guides/settings-starter.md) owns its copy/run procedure, and [support](../reference/support-matrix.md#settings-starter-evidence--2026-10-17) owns its validation evidence.

### Remaining milestone scope

Extend that same application in consumer order, with a bounded acceptance condition before each implementation slice:

Review authoring friction and grow widgets only from the application's needs. Add style conveniences or strengthen Row/Column, sizing, alignment, overflow and text-driven geometry only for demonstrated form requirements. Async observation, named slots, SplitPane, Stack/Overlay or bounded absolute positioning require their own consumer operation before becoming active work. Extend field editing only as application operations demand; full native text integration is not a release gate. Keep working source and [onboarding](../guides/getting-started.md) aligned as each operation is added; avoid publishing proposed syntax as a working guide.

### Release exit criteria

- A developer can create a small application through a high-level C++ API without low-level runtime assembly for ordinary UI composition; permanent syntax stability is not required.
- A basic component/widget library supports the reference application, including Text, Button, Row, Column, Checkbox and bounded TextInput. A complete widget inventory is not required.
- State and derived state have a simple public interface; reusable components support typed props/defaults, children, local state, command output, style attachment and stable identity where used. Conditional and repeated UI use the same runtime model.
- Common application styles are expressed without manually constructing low-level style machinery, and still resolve through the shared cascade/theme model.
- At least one application-shaped, copyable example exercises editing, scrolling, selection, styling, layout and host interaction through ordinary normalized input. Keyboard/gamepad navigation and command eligibility follow the common input boundary; platform claims require their own evidence.
- Deterministic replay, inspection and CPU-reference validation reproduce the application's accepted state, semantic observations, geometry and paint under declared inputs. Existing contract regressions remain covered.
- The runtime has one execution model for C++, documents, editor preview and automation. Run affected checks in Debug and Release and documentation checks; put configuration/results only in support and delivery history in the [changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md).

### Non-goals and stop condition

Do not make generalized lifecycle redesign, a new reactive graph, arbitrary reload migration, full reflection, generalized resource providers, complete Portal/OverlayRoot, full CSS/Grid, retained/incremental rendering, generalized multithreading, stable C ABI, Python/Rust/Go bindings, browser/WebGPU hosting, plugin frameworks, complete native accessibility, IDE tooling or a visual editor prerequisites for this release.

Stop milestone expansion when ordinary application authoring and the reference workflow meet these exit criteria. The [broader widget candidates](backlog.md#widget-candidates-beyond-the-reference-application), [editor extensions](backlog.md#unscheduled-editor-extensions), other language/platform work and performance candidates stay inactive until a concrete consumer promotes a bounded operation.
